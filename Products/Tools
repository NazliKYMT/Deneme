        "Description": "If we could bring only one eyeshadow brush with us to a desert island, we'd grab this classic pick by makeup legend Bobbi Brown. With synthetic bristles and a round, perfectly sloped head, it's ideal for defining your lash line, smoothing color into your crease, and all-over blending. This brush is designed for powdered shadows, effortlessly picking up and holding pigment until you tap off the excess or swipe it onto your lids.",

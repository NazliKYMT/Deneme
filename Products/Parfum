A calone accent creates a glac effect, like an inviting sorbet. The bottle is crafted with the mythological codes of the Versace DNA. The gold Medusa, and the Greek key engraved on the edge, stamp their imposing authority on the bottle. The Greek key is repeated on the back of the bottle, with a Medusa embossed on top of the cap. The fragrance is held in a high-quality deluxe coffret, with the elegant opening of a tiroir, typical of fine jewelry.
